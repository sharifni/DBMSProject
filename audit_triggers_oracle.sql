/*Bitmap indexes
Conventional wisdom holds that bitmap indexes are most appropriate for columns having low distinct values--such as GENDER, MARITAL_STATUS, and RELATION.
 This assumption is not completely accurate, however. In reality, a bitmap index is always advisable for systems in which data is not frequently updated 
by many concurrent systems. In fact, as I'll demonstrate here, a bitmap index on a column with 100-percent unique values (a column candidate for primary key)
 is as efficient as a B-tree index.

Oracle's two major index types are Bitmap indexes and B-Tree indexes. B-Tree indexes are the regular type that OLTP systems make much use of, and bitmap
 indexes are a highly compressed index type that tends to be used primarily for data warehouses.

Characteristic of Bitmap Indexes

For columns with very few unique values (low cardinality)
Columns that have low cardinality are good candidates (if the cardinality of a column is <= 0.1 %  that the column is ideal candidate, consider also 0.2% â€“ 1%)

Tables that have no or little insert/update are good candidates (static data in warehouse)
 
Stream of bits: each bit relates to a column value in a single row of table
create bitmap index person_region on person (region);

        Row     Region   North   East   West   South
        1       North        1      0      0       0
        2       East         0      1      0       0
        3       West         0      0      1       0
        4       West         0      0      1       0
        5       South        0      0      0       1
        6       North        1      0      0       0

Advantage of Bitmap Indexes

The advantages of them are that they have a highly compressed structure, making them fast to read and their structure makes it possible for the system to
 combine multiple indexes together for fast access to the underlying table.

RANK()
Determines the rank of a value in a group of values , based on the order by exp in the over clause

rows with equl values for the raniking criteria receive the same rank
add the no. of tied rows to the tied rank to calc the next rank and thus the ranks might not be consec nums

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMER MODIFY (PHONE ENCRYPT NO SALT);

Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) column encryption can be used for encrypting a specific column data in the database tables that are confidential, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers (SSN) and personal account numbers (PAN). This approach is useful when,

 

1.      The database tables are large.

 

2.      The columns holding the sensitive information are pre-known.


To create database tables with encrypted columns, we must use the ENCRYPT clause in its column definition in the CREATE TABLE statement as shown in the below example.

 

CREATE

  TABLE customer

  (

    cust_id      NUMBER,

    cust_name    VARCHAR2(100),

    cust_email   VARCHAR2(50) encrypt,

    cust_phone   NUMBER encrypt,

    cust_address VARCHAR2(3000) encrypt

  );

The TDE by default adds SALT (adding extra characters) to the column before its encryption. Adding SALT makes it tough for the stealers who use brute force method. We can also choose whether or not to SALT our column data before encrypting it irrespective of whether or not other encrypted columns use SALT.

 

We can also choose any other encrypting algorithm from the available list and define it through the USING clause as shown below,

 

CREATE

  TABLE customer

  (

    cust_id      NUMBER,

    cust_name    VARCHAR2(100),

    cust_email   VARCHAR2(50) encrypt no salt,

    cust_phone   NUMBER encrypt,

    cust_address VARCHAR2(3000) encrypt USING 'AES256'

  );

 

To add an encrypted column to an existing table in the database,
ALTER TABLE customer ADD (cust_ssn VARCHAR2(11) ENCRYPT USING 'AES256' salt);

To encrypt an existing column in a table in the database,
ALTER TABLE customer MODIFY (cust_name encrypt);

To decrypt an existing column in a table in the database,
ALTER TABLE customer MODIFY (cust_name decrypt);

To add SALT to an encrypted column in a table in the database,
ALTER TABLE customer MODIFY (cust_email encrypt salt); 

To remove SALT from an encrypted column in a table in the database,
ALTER TABLE customer MODIFY (cust_email encrypt no salt);

To change the encrypted key for the table containing one or more encrypted column,
ALTER TABLE customer rekey; 

To change the encryption algorithm for the table containing one or more encrypted column,
ALTER TABLE customer rekey USING '3DES168'; 

The TDE also adds a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to the data for integrity checking. The default integrity algorithm is SHA-1.
ALTER TABLE customer rekey USING '3DES168' 'SHA-1';

We can also use the parameter NOMAC for bypassing the integrity check, thus saving up to 20bytes of disk space per encrypted value.
ALTER TABLE customer rekey USING '3DES168' 'NOMAC';
